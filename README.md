# Analysis of 2500 TED videos
In this project I analyze 2500 TED videos.

The dataset is taken from the website Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/ted-talks

The following data was used for analysis: name, comments, duration, rating, event, film_date, main speaker, related talks, speaker occupation, tags and views.

The main library used for analysis is Pandas.
